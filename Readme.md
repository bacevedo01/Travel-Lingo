Our project's inspiration comes from backpacking in Europe and not having a quick reference for signage in another language. Many times travel books and language aids are abbreviated. They may have gaps in the language's syntax and phrases not outside of a common phrasebook and that's where our mobile app comes in.

<h2>The Solution:</h2>

Utilizing the embeded camera in the smart phone in your hand, Travelingoes autodetects and captures text via an optical character recognition or OCR.
It leverages the power of Google Translate for concise and accurate language translation. Travelingoes then using text to speech to pronounce the word in it's native language.
Our world currency converter can convert between 31 world currencies.

<h2>The Technology:</h2>

Our primary language is Swift and the editor environment is XCode.
We used pods which in the Ruby world are called gems to accomplish some of the tasks in our application, these include ABBYY OCR, ALAMOFIRE, Swifty JSON and Google Translate.
We created a custom user interface and user experience utilizing Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

Part of the technology solution was rapid prototyping. We didn't just make this one mobile app. We made several smaller apps to quickly test possible solutions, functionality and features.
Once we had a feature working on a test app, we integrated it into our main Travelingoes app. 

<h2>Methodology:</h2>

We utilized Basecamp, which is a lightweight project management tool to keep track of tasks, files, research notes, scheduling and internal team communications. It made breaking down of our goals into concrete action steps, easy and it kept us accountable to the project and each other. It was motivational to see how much progress we were making each day.
